# Pre-work Tip Calculator for Codepath

This application is an exercise to complete the application to Codepath's iOS for Designers bootcamp. There is not a huge investement on design nor a lot of complex code behind it, the exercise triest to touch

Time: I spent around 5-6 hours on the exercise

## What does the app can do?

* [x] Required: The user can calculate the tip, using diferent percentages

## What did I miss? 

* [ ] Better iPhone6 adaptation: I played with the layout properties a bit, and I made some things expand propely. Horizontally everything kind of work, but vertically the effect is broken
* [ ] Open/closed keyboar states: I tried to distribute the space in a better way wen you open or close the keyboard
* [ ] The code is a bit spaguetti, and I'm sure it is possible to refactor or clean a lot of the code there
